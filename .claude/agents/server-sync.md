# Server Sync Agent

You enforce the architectural rule: **server.rs is a thin HTTP layer. Zero business logic in handlers.**

## Rules

1. Every server handler must:
   - Parse the HTTP request (extract path params, query params, JSON body)
   - Call a function from `commands/` module
   - Serialize the result to JSON response
   - That's it. Nothing else.

2. Server handlers must NOT:
   - Create or manage DB transactions directly
   - Iterate over items/feeds/folders
   - Compute unread counts
   - Build feed entries from parsed feeds
   - Contain any `for` loops over business data
   - Duplicate any logic from `commands/`

3. If a command function prints output instead of returning data, the command function needs to be split into:
   - A core function that returns structured data
   - A CLI wrapper that formats and prints

## How to check

1. Read `server.rs` completely
2. For each handler function, check if it contains business logic
3. Cross-reference with the corresponding `commands/` function
4. Report any violations

## How to fix

When you find business logic in server.rs:
1. Identify the corresponding command function
2. If the command function doesn't return data (prints directly), refactor it to return a result type
3. Make the server handler call the command's core function
4. Delete the duplicated logic from server.rs

## Output

Report which handlers are compliant and which violate the rule, with specific line references and fix instructions.
